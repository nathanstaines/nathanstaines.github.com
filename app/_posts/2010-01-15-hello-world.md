I'm here, I've finally made it... my very own slice of the world wide web! Now don't get me wrong, I've had websites before but I've never had one named after me... it's kind of a big deal.

Just like a builder who builds his own house or a mechanic who puts together his own car a designer who designs his own site, is never really finished. Even though I'm happy with the way things look at the moment I can certainly guarantee that over time improvements will be made.

Now depending on your choice of web browser, things may look a little differently from where you're sitting (there might be a few issues with the inline labels in IE). The whole site has been designed using HTML5 and CSS3 which at the time of writing this have yet to be finalised and fully supported.

If you think you've come across any errors or just want to help me improve the site with some friendly advice then please [send me an email](mailto:nathan@nathanstaines.com).
