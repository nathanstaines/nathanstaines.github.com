Earlier this year I came to the realisation that I say HTML or more importantly the letter H, a little differently to a lot of others out there.

My journey of self discovery started with the release of a new WordPress theme which was initially going to be called 'Genesis: an HTML5 variant of Starkers' but seeing as there was already a theme framework with a similar name, [Elliot Jay Stocks](http://elliotjaystocks.com) and myself decided on 'Starkers HTML5' instead.

So my confusion lay in the use of 'an HTML' instead of 'a HTML'. At first I thought it was a simple typo by Elliot but then it dawned on me (thanks to a little bit of help from Google) that not all people pronounce the letter H the same way I do... weird I know.

### Aitch vs Haitch?

H is the eighth letter in the basic modern Latin alphabet. Its name in both British and American English is aitch, plural aitches, though it is also pronounced haitch if youâ€™re cool like me.

There is plenty of [information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H#Name_in_English) as to why there are two different pronunciations of the letter H but I'd personally like to thank the Catholics.

<figure class="figure-quote">
  <blockquote>We conducted a survey of the television programme Wheel of Fortune over a period of some weeks, just to see how many of the participants were aitchers and how many were haitchers. The results: 40% aitched and 60% haitched... Australians from a wide variety of backgrounds are haitchers these days.</blockquote>

### So is it an HTML or a HTML?

The rule of thumb is that you use 'a' before words that start with a consonant sound and 'an' before words that start with a vowel sound, so depending on how you pronounce the letter H will determine how you write it.

I personally say haitch instead of aitch and I understand that it's most likely the lesser of the two alternatives but I've always been one to cheer for the underdog.
