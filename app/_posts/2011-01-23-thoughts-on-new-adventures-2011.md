I had the opportunity this week to head up north to Nottingham along with another 600+ fellow web geeks for the inaugural [New Adventures in web design conference](http://newadventuresconf.com/).

From the moment I arrived at St Pancras train station it felt like I was playing a real life version of 'Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?' it seemed like I had just missed other conference goers by only a matter of hours when I checked in on Gowalla.

This trend continued until after I had checked in at the Premier Inn (where everything's premier but the price) and headed on out to the now famous:

### Erskine Bowling

The guys from [Erskine Design](http://erskinedesign.com/) organized a great night of bowling, creating a nice laid-back atmosphere where the conference attendees could catch up and enjoy themselves in a social setting before having to put their thinking caps on the next morning.

As far as the bowling was concerned everyone seemed to peak early except wee [@jackosborne](http://twitter.com/jackosborne) who improved *only slightly* as the night went on.

Now I haven't exactly been to a lot of web design conferences but I'm pretty sure it's safe to say that the people who go look forward to these sort of social events almost as much as the conference talks themselves.

During the course of the night I had the pleasure of meeting some amazing people from within our industry where many great conversations were had.

And even though I wasn't lucky enough to be apart of a bowling team I did get the opportunity to knock over a few pins every now and then.

I didn't stick around to see which team was crowned champions but overall the night to me was plenty of fun.

### Conference Speakers

Thursday brought with it a reasonably early start, a queue around the corner to get inside Albert Hall and plenty of coffee in hand.

Over the course of the day there were some brilliant ideas and opinions presented from some of the industry's most respected voices like Dan Rubin, Mark Boulton, Sarah Parmenter, Elliot Jay Stocks, Jon Tan, Tim Van Damme, Greg Wood, Veerle Pieters, Andy Clarke and Brendan Dawes.

All *my favourite* talks in one way or another seemed to revolve around **the content**. From Mark Boulton's idea of designing from the content out, not the canvas in, to Greg Wood's personal experiment with art directed/editorial design and whether or not this works on the web, then finally Andy Clarke's idea of telling stories with 'Once upon a time on the web'.

For me the conference accomplished everything it set out to do:

> New Adventures... will be carefully curated; chock-full of integrity, opinion, and fresh content, with an emphasis on shaking things up and challenging convention. This event has inspiration, thinking, and intelligence at its core. It will encourage debate, enthuse, excite, ask questions, and look for real outcomes.

Now although New Adventures was always billed as having a fast-paced punchy format, my one and only criticism would be to say that 10 speakers in a day is a lot to take on - and a lot to take in.

### The After Party

Once the conference had officially finished up I headed back to the hotel with a couple of the <abbr title="Great Bunch of Lads">GBOLs</abbr> to drop off our stuff and head out for some food.

A few hours later and we arrived at Escucha to find plenty of fellow web geeks catching up on the days events.

There's always a few factors at play when it comes to hosting a successful after party (in my opinion at least). The venue, the free tab at the bar and the volume. All of which were spot on!

### Final Thoughts

Overall the New Adventures in web design conference in my eyes was a huge success, I love the opportunity to catch up with other people in our industry to discuss and/or question the direction in which we're all headed.
