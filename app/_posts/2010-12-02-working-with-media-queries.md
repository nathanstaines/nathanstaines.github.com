The use of media queries simply allows us to apply different CSS styles based on resolution and/or device orientation. It uses the same old media declaration that we've used for serving up print stylesheets but now it just has a few more features under its belt.

**Everyone's doing it**... ok, so maybe not everyone but it's definitely starting to gain some traction amongst the designers who are prepared to push the boundaries - or at the very least experiment with them from time to time.

### How do we use them?

First we need to set the viewport to device-width

{% gist 9421235 index-a.html %}

We can either link to external stylesheets

{% gist 9421235 index-b.html %}

Or add them to an existing stylesheet

{% gist 9421235 main.css %}

### Is it supported?

The browser support for media queries is actually pretty good. The latest versions of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera are all using it. Internet Explorer 9 will be, but IE8 and below do not :( however there is a [jQuery media queries plugin](http://plugins.jquery.com/project/MediaQueries) - for those not-so-capable browsers.

### Final thoughts

One thing to keep in mind - Although we can now tailor our designs to suit different devices we'll still be dealing with the exact same content. ([CSS3 flexbox](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/) can help rearrange some content if necessary) So even if we decide to use CSS to hide images on the iPhone, they'll still be downloaded by the user.
