**I've finally decided to do the responsible thing and go *responsive* with my website.**

Today, sites are being viewed on a number of different devices and browsers each with differing dimensions and screen resolutions, gone are the days of the one size fits all design philosophy.

Ethan Marcotte outlines in his game changing book ['Responsive Web Design'](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) that fluid grids, flexible images and media queries are the three technical ingredients that are needed for responsive web design, but that it also requires a different way of thinking.

So equipped with this new found knowledge I set out to create a WordPress theme that would allow users to easily read the content on this site regardless of screen size. I decided to take what I already knew from working with [Starkers HTML5](https://github.com/nathanstaines/starkers-html5) and mixed it together with the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://h5bp.com) and Andy Clarke's [320 & Up](http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/) boilerplate extension.

###A fresh coat of paint

While I was at it with the whole *responsive* thing I also thought I'd go with a new [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) inspired colour scheme, a homage to [Flight of the Conchords](http://flightoftheconchords.co.nz/) on the homepage and the inclusion of [Maykel Loomans' pull quote technique](http://miekd.com/articles/pull-quotes-with-html5-and-css/) on some of the blog posts and pages.

###What next?

I'm hoping this new look will inspire me to write blog posts a little more frequently but as always, only time will tell...
